2022-10-21 05:45:12+00:00,"@ThorstenBasch @spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Russia overrunning Ukraine would destabilize the entire region, perhaps the world"

2022-10-21 05:09:52+00:00,@jamesplloyd @SpaceX I do. Yes.
2022-10-21 05:06:29+00:00,"@spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Still very unlikely, but this is the closest we’ve been since Cuba in ‘62"

2022-10-20 17:42:06+00:00,@PPathole @EvaFoxU @DavidSacks Compromise is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome – just a question of how much death &amp; destruction happens before then
2022-10-20 17:39:15+00:00,@gaborgurbacs @EvaFoxU @DavidSacks That should be the nature of the debate
2022-10-20 17:32:08+00:00,"@EvaFoxU @DavidSacks Most probable outcome by far is a horrible war of attrition that destroys Ukraine &amp; severely damages Russia, with massive body count on both sides.

And, in the end, the same outcome. 

So why?"
